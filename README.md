<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

### Useful resources

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - The resources on HTML provided by W3Schools were instrumental in helping me understand the structure and semantics of web pages. I particularly appreciated the clear explanations and practical examples, which I will continue to use in future projects.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - The comprehensive guide on CSS by W3Schools significantly enhanced my understanding of styling and layout. The detailed tutorials and examples made it easier to grasp complex concepts, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their CSS skills.
